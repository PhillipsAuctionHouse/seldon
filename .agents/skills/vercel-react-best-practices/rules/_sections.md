# Sections

This file defines all sections, their ordering, impact levels, and descriptions.
The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.

**`@phillips/seldon`:** Sections **1 (async-)** and **3 (server-)** primarily target
full-stack apps (Next.js Route Handlers, SSR data loading). For **library-only**
component work here, lean on **2, 5, 6, 7, 8** first; use **1** when async logic
ships inside components; treat **3** as guidance for **consumers**, not default
in-repo work.

## 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (async)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Waterfalls are the #1 performance killer. Each sequential await adds full network latency. Eliminating them yields the largest gains.

## 2. Bundle Size Optimization (bundle)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Reducing initial bundle size improves Time to Interactive and Largest Contentful Paint.

## 3. Server-Side Performance (server)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Optimizing server-side rendering and data fetching eliminates server-side waterfalls and reduces response times.

## 4. Client-Side Data Fetching (client)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Description:** Automatic deduplication and efficient data fetching patterns reduce redundant network requests.

## 5. Re-render Optimization (rerender)

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Reducing unnecessary re-renders minimizes wasted computation and improves UI responsiveness.

## 6. Rendering Performance (rendering)

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Optimizing the rendering process reduces the work the browser needs to do.

## 7. JavaScript Performance (js)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Description:** Micro-optimizations for hot paths can add up to meaningful improvements.

## 8. Advanced Patterns (advanced)

**Impact:** LOW  
**Description:** Advanced patterns for specific cases that require careful implementation.
